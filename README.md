# TaskMaster

## 🚀 About the Project

This is the frontend for **TaskMaster**, a distributed job scheduling platform that supports both periodic and one-time jobs. Users can input shell commands via this web interface, which are then scheduled and executed by distributed worker nodes through a powerful backend system.

## 🛠️ Backend Overview

The backend of AutoChronos is designed to handle job scheduling and execution with high efficiency and scalability. It uses **Node.js**, **Redis**, and **BullMQ** to manage a job queue system. When a command is submitted through the frontend, it is passed to the backend via API calls. The backend then schedules the job and assigns it to a worker, which executes the command on its local system. Periodic jobs are managed using cron expressions. The backend is deployed using **Render**, and supports containerization via **Docker Swarm** for distributed execution.
